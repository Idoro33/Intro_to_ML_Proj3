# Intro to ML project 3
## Next-Word Prediction Using Neural Networks
This project focuses on developing a neural network capable of predicting the next word in a sentence based on the preceding three words. Through this task, the model will learn both word relationships and how to represent words numerically. Additionally, we will analyze the word embeddings generated by the network, gaining insights into their structure and meaning.
